**The Universal Handshake Protocol: Bridging AI Agents, Virtual Machines, and Human Control**

TreeTee is a comprehensive platform that allows AI agents to use computers exactly as humans do, providing secure monitoring, tracing, and remote control capabilities for both virtual and physical machines.

## üöÄ Overview

TreeTee bridges the gap between AI agents and computer systems by creating a secure monitoring environment where:

- AI agents can control virtual and physical machines via VNC/RDP
- Humans can observe agent actions in real-time
- Users can take over control at any time with native mouse and keyboard
- All sessions run in secure, verified Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

## üîí Security & Verification

TreeTee operates completely in the cloud with strong security guarantees:

- All components are containerized for consistent deployment
- Runs in verified TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments)
- Certificates for agent control are generated and signed within the original containers
- Access is limited to authorized accounts only

## üß© Core Components

### 1. TreeTee VNC Monitoring Tool and Agent Deployer
The central monitoring platform that allows you to:
- Deploy and manage AI agents
- Monitor agent activities in real-time
- Take over control when needed
- Grant selective access to capabilities

### 2. CUA-API/VM (Computer Use Agent)
The virtual machine and API used by AI agents to:
- Execute actions on virtual or physical machines
- Process LLM commands through the Python intermediary server
- Provide VNC/RDP access to the controlled machine
- Enable file sharing, terminal access, and messaging

## üîå Integration with Open Source Tools

TreeTee leverages battle-tested open source technologies:

- **MeshCentral**: For secure remote device management
- **Goose**: For virtualization and machine control
- **Privy**: For secure authentication and identity management

## üö™ Access Control & Sharing

TreeTee provides granular control over agent capabilities:
- Programmatically grant temporary access to specific agent capabilities
- Share or sell access to your agents with fine-grained permissions
- Control desktop viewing, interaction, file sharing, terminal access, and messaging
