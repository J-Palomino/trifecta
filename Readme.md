**The Universal Handshake Protocol: Bridging AI Agents, Virtual Machines, and Human Control**

TreeTee is a comprehensive platform that allows AI agents to use computers exactly as humans do, providing secure monitoring, tracing, and remote control capabilities for both virtual and physical machines.

## üöÄ Overview

TreeTee bridges the gap between AI agents and computer systems by creating a secure monitoring environment where:

- AI agents can control virtual and physical machines via VNC/RDP
- Humans can observe agent actions in real-time
- Users can take over control at any time with native mouse and keyboard
- All sessions run in secure, verified Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

## üîí Security & Verification

TreeTee operates completely in the cloud with strong security guarantees:

- All components are containerized for consistent deployment
- Runs in verified TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments)
- Certificates for agent control are generated and signed within the original containers
- Access is limited to authorized accounts only
- [Verified by Phala Network TEE](https://cloud.phala.network/explorer/app_48dc0b7e647cbbfef16f2ae6cf2d5ca99d129402)

## üß© Core Components

### 1. TreeTee VNC Monitoring Tool and Agent Deployer
The central monitoring platform that allows you to:
- Deploy and manage AI agents
- Monitor agent activities in real-time
- Take over control when needed
- Grant selective access to capabilities

### 2. CUA-API/VM (Computer Use Agent)
The virtual machine and API used by AI agents to:
- Execute actions on virtual or physical machines
- Process LLM commands through the Python intermediary server
- Provide VNC/RDP access to the controlled machine
- Enable file sharing, terminal access, and messaging

## üîå Integration with Open Source Tools

TreeTee leverages battle-tested open source technologies:

- **MeshCentral**: For secure remote device management
- **Goose**: For virtualization and machine control
- **Privy**: For secure authentication and identity management

## üö™ Access Control & Sharing

TreeTee provides granular control over agent capabilities:
- Programmatically grant temporary access to specific agent capabilities
- Share or sell access to your agents with fine-grained permissions
- Control desktop viewing, interaction, file sharing, terminal access, and messaging

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Deploy TreeTee monitoring platform:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/J-Palomino/trifecta.git
cd trifecta

# For development
docker-compose up -d

# For production (more secure volume mounts)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

2. Deploy the Computer Use Agent VM:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/j-palomino/openai-cua-sample-app:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/j-palomino/openai-cua-sample-app:latest
```

### Configuration

1. **Create environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Required environment variables:**
   - `HOSTNAME` - Your deployment domain
   - `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` - Email for SSL certificate registration

3. **Generate configuration files:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate-config.sh
   ./generate-config.sh
   ```

4. **Security Note:** Never commit `.env` or certificate files to version control. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

5. Set up authentication credentials for Privy integration (see documentation)

6. Configure MeshCentral for your specific deployment needs

## üîß Advanced Use Cases

- **Commercial Deployment**: Create AI agents that perform tasks on behalf of users
- **Development & Testing**: Create automated workflows for software testing
- **Customer Support**: Deploy agents that can assist users by demonstrating procedures
- **Training & Education**: Create AI tutors that can demonstrate computer skills

## üîê Security

TreeTee takes security seriously. This repository follows security best practices:

- **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data uses environment variables
- **Certificate management** - SSL/TLS certificates are never committed to version control
- **GitHub Secrets integration** - CI/CD pipelines use GitHub Secrets Manager
- **Regular audits** - Dependencies and code are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities
